            <p>The script of this video is adapted from one of the famous books of Liang Xiaosheng called <i>Father</i>, in which the author Liang gave a detailed description to his father who was strictly following the stereotyped rule of the old society and extended to aware people of the conflicts between the traditional concept and the new generation.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Main Conflict</h2>

            <p>The pivotal part of the conflict is the old and new generation held completely opposite idea towards education. The former one believed that productivity is the most significant and family should ensure its financial income instead of spending
            those money for studying. However, the new society and the trend of the development of the modern world was calling for higher and more sophisticated education.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">The elder brother was emphasising the importance of higher education</span>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The persuasion of the counselor</h2>

            <p>According to Liang's book, the elder brother was permitted to entre the university, but unfortunately committed suicide later because of the high pressure, which
            making his father more convinced that higher education is not going to be a good thing.</p>

            <p>At this moment a critical character - the counselor of the university came and used the modern point of view to persuade
            father, hoping he can allow the younger brother to study in the university. And it was a good news that father again finally agreed.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">University counselor is persuading the father</span>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Debating with young scholar</h2>

            <p>The turing point of the whole story is at the part while younger brother had become a manager and having a talk or rather a debate with a young scholar. In
            our script, we completely copied the original lines of this part from the book.</p>

            <p>It is during the debate that the younger brother pointed out the cause of his sister and elder brothers death. The crux is directly elaborated as his father's
            foolish, which was inadvertently heard by his father.</p>

            <p>Knowing his son was looking down upon him, father packed up and left home again. It is a kind relief to see father finally realised his fault and the younger brother also
            understanding that the main problem is not his father, but the foolish of the whole uneducated collective.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Younger brother is criticising foolish in the debate with young scholar</span>

            <p>From the final part of the story we deeply felt that understanding is one of the most vital things that we must have so as to be tolerant or forgiving mistakes.
            This is also the reason why we translated the English title into <i>Long Live the Understanding</i></p>
